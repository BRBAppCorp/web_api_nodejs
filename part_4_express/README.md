# Part 4: Implemented Routing using Express.js

## ⭐ What is Express ?

Express is a minimal Node.js framework which means it is built on top of Node.js. Providing a higher level of abstraction. It can be considered as a layer built on top of Node.js that deals with the server and routes.

Express consists of very powerful and useful features to develop web and mobile applications such as

- Complex Routing
- Easier handling of request and responses
- Setting up middlewares
- Server-Side Rendering and many more.
  Owing to all such powerful features, it allows rapid development of Node.js applications because we don't have to re-invent the wheel basically.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Once you've downloaded the repo, Open it in an editor of your choice.

3. Open the terminal and traverse to **part_4_express** directory.

4. Now run command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

5. Now run command `node app.js` to start the server.

6. Open Postman and go to `127.0.0.1:3000` to see your server running.

7. Go to `GET 127.0.0.1:3000`, `POST 127.0.0.1:3000/data`, `GET 127.0.0.1:3000/any-route` to test the working of the routes.
