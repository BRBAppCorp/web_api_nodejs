# Part 2 : Implementing Routing in Node.js

## ⭐ What is Routing ?

Routing basically means implementing different actions for different URLs. For instance,
`www.facebook.com/messages` takes you to the message route, while `www.facebook.com/notifications` takes you to the notifications route, similarly `www.facebook.com/friends` takes you to some altogether different route.

In this repository, routing has been implemented from scratch, without using any dependencies.

We have implemented the routing using `url module` in Node.js.

**url** is a built-in module in Node.js. It provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Once you've downloaded the repo, Open it in an editor of your choice.

3. Open the terminal and traverse to **part_2** directory.

4. Now run command `node index.js` to start the server.

5. Open your browser and go to `127.0.0.1:8000` to see your server running.

6. Go to `127.0.0.1:8000/overview`, `127.0.0.1:8000/product`,
   `127.0.0.1:8000/api`,
   `127.0.0.1:8000/random-page` to test various routes defined in the program.
