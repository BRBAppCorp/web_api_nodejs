# Part 3: Creating Web API in Node.js

## ⭐ What is an API ?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, to allow applications to talk to each other.

**Web API** in particular simply refers to an app that sends data to a client whenever a request comes in. Here, we have client and server talking to each other through the API.

In this part, we have created a simple Web API, using JSON data from a file.

## 🚀 Get Started

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Once you've downloaded the repo, Open it in an editor of your choice.

3. Open the terminal and traverse to **part_2** directory.

4. Now run command `node index.js` to start the server.

5. Open your browser and go to `127.0.0.1:8000` to see your server running.

6. Go to `127.0.0.1:8000/api`, to test the working of the API. Refer to `dev-data/apiData.json` to see the dummy JSON data that we have used.
