## ‚≠ê What is a Web Server ?

A Web Server is basically a system that accepts requests from the client and sends back responses.

We have built a simple web server using `http module` in Node.js.

**http** is a built-in module in Node.js. It provides us with all the networking capabilities, such as creating a HTTP server. It allows Node.js to transfer data over the HTTP(Hypertext Transfer protocol).
